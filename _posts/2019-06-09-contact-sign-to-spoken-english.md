### Contacting Me
You may contact me at any time via e-mail or by arranging a meeting time before or after class. If you need to contact me, try these methods:

### E-methods (most effective)
* dstringham (at) gmail.com (also Google Hangouts)
* [Canvas](https://uvu.instructure.com)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stringd)
* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) private message

### On campus
Catch or make an appointment with me before/after class in LI 212.

### Phone
If you absolutely need to use the phone, you may call my mobile phone (ask me for the number); please do not call my home (do you really want my teenaged kids answering your important call?).

### ASL & Deaf Studies Department Chair
Hopefully, you wonâ€™t need to bother my supervisor, but if you must, you can contact the ASL & Deaf Studies Coordinator, Dr. Bryan Eldredge, LA003f; (801) 863-8529 V/VP.
