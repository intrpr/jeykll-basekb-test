## Developing semantic understanding between spoken English and signed languages

Not only is having an expert command of spoken English and signed-language skills requisite to producing transliterated work, connecting these abilities for simultaneous production is also fundamental. A significant portion of this course will be spent on discussing, reacquiring, and synthesizing knowledge and fluency of grammatical skills inherent in both languages.

Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:
* How does X grammatical aspect manifest itself in signed language and spoken English? How does X differ in both languages and what can I do to create equivalent meaning in both?
* Will my language choices affect the intended register?
* What lessons and principles from spoken English impact my ability to produce a transliterated equivalent?

##### Readings/Discussions
#### Cohesion & Transitional Devices (Spoken English)
This two-page handout taxonomizes four types of spoken English cohesion and transitional devices: additive, adversative, causal, and sequential transitions. Helpful in organizing mind/discoursal maps. Required

#### Interpreters for Deaf Cut Through D.C.’s Political Jargon
Intralingual prowess cuts both ways: interpreters need to now how to pick the right words, but also be able to render equivalent ASL. Disappointing to see his strategy of “When lost in a minefield of jargon, the rule is ‘Spell, and you’re out of there,’” though.
(Update 15 Jan 2014: There is a fairly spirited discussion about this article on RID’s Facebook page; you’ll need to search for the shared link to the WSJ article; sign-in probably required.)

This link is not about Marlee, it’s about listening to how interpreter Jack Jason uses spoken English prosody, tone, affect, speed, and illocutionary force to make this a presentation, and not an interpreting assignment.

#### Why Academic ASL Exposure Matters to Sign Language Interpreters
2016 Street Leverage presentation by Ben Bahan (Gallaudet University) reminding interpreters that “each discipline of study in the academy has its own approach to discourse,” and one of the reasons why interpretations in academic settings are lacking: a lack of exposure to language in these disciplines.
