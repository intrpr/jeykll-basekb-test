## Developing semantic understanding between spoken English and signed languages

intro paragraph
Here are some bullet points/learning outcomes of which we might want to be aware:

##### Readings/Discussions
#### Interpreting Culturally Rich Realities: Research Implications for Successful Interpretations (Cokely)
This is a pre-published version of this article by Dennis Cokely, Dean of the ASL Program at Northeastern University, regarding meaning in ASL vocabularies and interpretations. (Published citation/reference: Cokely, D. (2001). Interpreting culturally rich realities: Research implications for successful interpretations. Journal of Interpretation, 2001.) We’ll be using this article to talk about message intent, vis-a-vis listening. Required

#### Interpreters, Conversational Style, and Gender at Work (Morgan)
This is chapter 5 in Hauser (2008) Deaf Professionals and Designated Interpreters by my colleague Elizabeth Morgan. This reading addresses the concept of power language and the role of gender in creating power/less language. Required
***
#### Does gender style contribute to tech industry diversity?
A more-recent corollary to Morgan’s article, this discussion of resume writing styles in Fortune Magazine explores an interesting point about the different (perceived) narrative style of men and women. Author Kieran Snyder observes differences in writing length, detail inclusion, credential inclusion, and personal background. How do these styles impact message creation, (does it) impact Deaf narrative creation, and interpretation approaches?

#### Simons/Chabris Selective Attention Test
***
#### Listening to humor and comedy
President Obama’s performance and Cecily Strong’s standup set from the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. How does a listener (much less an interpreter) learn to distinguish from surface-level language choices and deeper semantic intent? Where does the comedy actually take place? Is the ‘funny’ in the delivery or the semantic intent? What is required to render L1 semantics in an L2?
***
#### How to Wield Empathy
Admittedly, this article has nothing directly to do with SL interpreting; it’s about user experience design, the practice of getting into the psychology of web/internet use. But replace “design” with “interpret” and the sentiment takes on a new light. Is there room for ‘user/consumer’ empathy in our work?

#### Powerless language: Are your words holding you back?
***
#### Eye fixation study
Eye fixation study results show how we actually read and process texts. What implications does this have for interpreters?
