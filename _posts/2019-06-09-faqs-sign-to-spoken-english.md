Do you have any class notes or handouts on this site?
Most of the information in the teacher’s presentations and lecture outline is found in your text and on the [Schedule/Units pages](http://). Sometimes, specific class notes or charts may be distributed on an infrequent basis. These handouts are important; exam and discussion materials will also come from these resources.

### When does class meet?
Class time and period are TR 7:00–8:40 pm in LA 230. [Read the syllabus](http://) for more information.

### How can I contact the instructor?
The best way to contact me is via e-mail. [Go to the contact page](http://) for more information.

### How do I get a good grade in this class?
Please note: This is a skill-based class; final grades are based on your 1) participation and 2) your demonstrated interpreting acumen and ability; this is a main reason for having a pre- and post-/final assessment. Yes, we spend time learning about contemporary interpreting theory and yes, you should implant that in your archival memory somewhere. Your final grade is not necessarily based on your perception of nor what you think about your acumen and ability.
Course final grades are determined by combining both

* scores on all of the [submitted assignments and exams](http://)
* in-class participation
More importantly, you should remember that making decisions in interpreting situations or producing interpreting work is really all about efficient and fluent problem solving: identifying and then applying knowledge to resolve communication differences.

While some portions of your coursework and exams will test for specific factual who-when-where information (‘remembering’ skills), far less important is your ability to regurgitate facts and figures. Instead, [assignments and exams](http://) are designed to identify how well you internalize principles, cultural and technical knowledge, and process understanding, and then apply them to create solutions to various situations (‘applying’ and ‘analyzing’ skills). [Learn more about higher-level learning at the FAQs page](http://).

### When are assignments due? When is the final? What’s on the quizzes? The exams?
All schedule-related questions can be answered on the [class schedule](http://). Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the college. Please don’t ask. All written exams will consist of questions designed to test your knowledge of class lectures and important information found in the text and handouts. [Read more on the assignments page](http://).

### Want to learn more about higher-level learning? 
Try [Bloom’s (revised) Taxonomy](http://) or [this list of action verbs based on Bloom’s](http://). Skills higher up on the pyramid are necessary for equivalent interpreting; our class assignments and exams will require you to demonstrate performance on several levels. (Anderson, L. W., & Krathwohl, D. R. (Eds.). (2001). A taxonomy for learning, teaching and assessing: *A revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy of educational objectives*. New York: Longman.)

[Scoring criteria](http://) are clearly defined on assignment handouts or exams; you’ll know what you need to do to [earn the grade you want](http://). Ultimately, your grade is a reflection of personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.
