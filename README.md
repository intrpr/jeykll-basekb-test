## Setup

1. Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics, Disqus and MailChimp keys to `_config.yml`.
3. Get a workflow going to see your site's output (with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) or Jekyll locally).

## Develop

Base was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.4.3, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

## Editing

Base is already optimised for adding, updating and removing tutorials, navigation, footer and FAQ information in CloudCannon.

The sticky sidebar in tutorials in populated by pulling out `<h2>` elements from the content.

### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* The tutorials page is organised by categories.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Post Series
To create a new series:

* Add a new document to the `sets` collection.
* Set the `title` and `description`.

To add a tutorial/post to a series:
* Add a `set` field to the tutorial front matter which points to the file name of the desired set without the `.md` extention. e.g. If I have a set at `_sets/getting-started.md` I would use this in my tutorial front matter: `set: getting-started`.
* Add a `set_order` field to the tutorial front matter and specify a number. This is the tutorials order in the set.

### Navigation

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Navigation* section.

### Footer

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Footer* section.
